# hello_github

This is my first upload to Github or, to be honest, any online site ever. It is a start to what I hope is a long journey into the world of software development.

The code is simple. Once you run it, it will display
```
Hello there

General Kenobi
```

To run this in your Windows command line, open **Command Prompt** by typing cmd and pressing enter in the *Run dialog box* (Win key+R).  
Then, change into the directory were you have stored this script by using the command
```
cd <file path>
```
Then, tyoe the following and press enter
```
python hello_there.py
```
